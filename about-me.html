            <p>Darragh Briscomb is a Web and Mobile Development Student at the University of Suffolk, and the LGBTQ+ Officer at the University of Suffolk's Student Union. He loves video games - Witcher 3, Skyrim, Spiderman, Banished to name a few - and Superheros (particularly Hawkeye) and thrives most when learning or experiencing new things. His main aim in life is to make the world slightly better, and is somewhat of a serial volunteer.</p>
            <p>Darragh's main skills are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Web Development (Mostly Front End)</li>
              <li>Event Management</li>
              <li>Advertising and Design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In his work as LGBTQ+ Officer, Darragh has hosted many events in coalition with the LGBTQ+ Society, and has been the team lead on a variety of SU events. In the upcoming future, Darragh will be the main contact for the University's version of LGBTQ+ History month, and is working closely with the Staff Network to accomplish this.</p>
            <p>Outside of University, Darragh is an Administrator and Tech Lead on a gender-diverse Discord, with the aim of creating a safe space for trans+ individuals to express themselves without judgement. He is also an advocate for LGBTQ+ issues, and has spoken at conferences about Trans+ Mental health. He has also sat on the Tavistock and Portman AGM panel, sharing his story and taking questions from the audience.</p>
            <p>Darragh dabbles in poetry in his spare time and often writes LGBTQ+ poetry during charged events such as transgender day of remembrance, or in response to the GRA consultation.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Darragh strives for equality, but also for equity to ensure that those disadvantaged are lifted in order to achieve their true potential.</p>
